<p>Scottish Government's&nbsp;overall approach to energy is driven by the need&nbsp;to decarbonise the whole energy system, in line&nbsp;with emissions levels set out in the Climate&nbsp;Change (Scotland) Act.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2019/15/contents/enacted">Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Act 2019</a>&nbsp;set <strong>targets</strong> to reduce Scotland's <strong>emissions</strong> of all greenhouse gases to <strong>net-zero</strong> by <strong>2045</strong> at the latest, five years ahead of the UK.&nbsp; The Act also sets <strong>interim targets</strong> for <strong>reductions</strong> of at least <strong>56%</strong> by <strong>2020</strong>, <strong>75%</strong> by <strong>2030</strong>, <strong>90%</strong> by <strong>2040</strong> from a <strong>baseline</strong> of emissions in <strong>1990</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, Scottish source <strong>emissions</strong> of the basket of seven greenhouse gases were estimated to be <strong>41.6 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent</strong> (MtCO2e). This is <strong>1.5% higher</strong> than <strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The main contributor to this increase between 2017 and 2018 was a <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>energy supply emissions</strong>&nbsp;driven almost&nbsp;entirely by increased emissions from power stations.</p>
<p>Between <strong>1990</strong> and <strong>2018</strong>, there was a <strong>45.4%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>reduction</strong> in estimated emissions. The most significant contributors to this&nbsp;overall reduction were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fall in <strong>energy supply</strong> emissions (<strong>down 70.1%</strong>)</li>
<li>&lsquo;<strong>Land use, Land use change and forestry</strong>&rsquo; (LULUCF) becoming a greater sink,&nbsp;<strong>offsetting</strong> an additional <strong>5.1 MtCO2e</strong> of emissions.</li>
<li>Fall in <strong>waste management</strong> emissions (such as Landfill) (<strong>down 72.2%</strong>)</li>
<li>Fall in <strong>business</strong> emissions (<strong>down 32.2%</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest factor <strong>slowing</strong> the overall <strong>reduction</strong> is <strong>transport</strong>. This sector was the largest contributor in 2018 at <strong>12.9 MtCO2e</strong>,&nbsp;however has shown only a <strong>4.9% decrease</strong> since <strong>1990</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
