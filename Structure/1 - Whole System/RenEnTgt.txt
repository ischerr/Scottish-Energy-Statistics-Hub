<p>Scotland's renewable energy target is calculated by the sum of renewable electricity and heat generation and estimated biofuel use in transport in Scotland, divided by Scotland's gross electricity consumption, non-electrical heat demand and energy used for transport. Therefore, progress towards the target will come from&nbsp;<strong>increasing renewable generation&nbsp;</strong><em>and</em><strong>&nbsp;reducing energy consumption.</strong></p>
<p>Provisional figures for&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;indicate that&nbsp;<strong>21.1%</strong>&nbsp;of total Scottish energy consumption came from renewable sources; the highest level to date. It <strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>19.3%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>. Renewable energy generated <strong>increased</strong> by more than&nbsp;<strong>2,500 GWh</strong> between <strong>2017</strong> and <strong>2018</strong>. This includes over&nbsp;<strong>1,500 GWh</strong> extra renewable <strong>electricity</strong> generated thanks to an additional <strong>0.7 GW</strong> installed capacity between 2017 and 2018, mainly from onshore and offshore wind. Renewable electricity contributes about four-fifths of all Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy, followed by renewable heat and biofuels in transport.</p>
<p>The total amount of renewable energy generated in 2018&nbsp;(<strong>33,652 GWh</strong>)&nbsp;is the equivalent of powering and heating more than&nbsp;<strong>1.93 million households</strong>&nbsp;in Scotland, assuming average electricity and gas usage for households in Scotland.</p>
