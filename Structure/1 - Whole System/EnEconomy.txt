<p>Scotland&rsquo;s <strong>energy</strong> (including renewables) <strong>sector</strong> was identified in <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-economic-strategy/">Scotland&rsquo;s Economic Strategy </a>as one of the growth sectors in which Scotland can build on existing comparative advantage and increase productivity and growth. The sector is defined using the <strong>Standard Industrialisation Classification (SIC) 2007</strong> codes that can be found <a href="https://www2.gov.scot/Resource/0054/00547085.docx">here.</a> Due to the sector definitions, the figures are not directly comparable with those on the low carbon and renewable sector or the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gross value added (GVA)</span></strong> for the Energy growth sector totalled <strong>&pound;20.8 billion</strong> in <strong>2018, up 11%</strong>&nbsp;on <strong>2017</strong>&nbsp;to its highest level since 2013.&nbsp; This increase is driven by a 33% rise in GVA associated with extraction of <strong>oil</strong> and <strong>gas</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>turnover </strong></span>in&nbsp;the Scottish energy sector was&nbsp;<strong>&pound;40.8 billion </strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2018, down 8%</strong>&nbsp;in nominal terms on&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp; This is largely attributable to some companies adopting new accounting standards in Annual Business Survey returns in 2018, therefore care should be taken when making comparisons over time to 2018.</p>
<p>Total <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>exports</strong> </span>from the Energy growth sector stood at <strong>&pound;14.6 billion</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>, accounting for <strong>17%</strong> of <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s total exports</strong>. Exports from this sector <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>5%</strong> over the latest year.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Employment</strong> </span>in the energy sector stood at <strong>71,000 in 2019</strong>, up from <strong>67,000 </strong>in <strong>2018.</strong> <strong>Scotland</strong> accounted for <strong>21%</strong> of employment in Energy across <strong>Great Britain</strong> as a whole. Employment in the energy sector is highly <strong>concentrated</strong> in the <strong>North-East </strong>with<strong> 39%</strong> of all jobs in <strong>Aberdeen City</strong> and <strong>14%</strong> in <strong>Aberdeenshire.</strong></p>
