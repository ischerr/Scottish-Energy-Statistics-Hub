<p>In <strong>2019</strong>, Scotland had <strong>193&nbsp;</strong>separate <strong>combined heat and power schemes</strong> in domestic and non-domestic buildings, steadily <strong>rising </strong>from <strong>70 </strong>in <strong>2005</strong>. In total, Scotland&rsquo;s combined heat and power schemes generated <strong>5,374 GWh </strong>of <strong>heat </strong>in <strong>2019</strong> which would have been wasted otherwise.&nbsp; This is a drop of 12.6% on 2018.</p>
<p>While the number of CHP <strong>schemes </strong>in Scotland have <strong>increased</strong>, the amount of <strong>heat generated </strong>has <strong>dropped </strong>by over&nbsp;<strong>3,000 GWh </strong>from its peak in <strong>2005</strong>. This mirrors the UK wide trend of the cessation of larger industrial based schemes that generate high amounts of heat and the growth of smaller non-industrial schemes.</p>
