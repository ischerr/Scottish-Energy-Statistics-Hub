<p>Insight into how the Scottish public engage with energy comes from examining those that are with their <strong>&lsquo;home&rsquo; supplier </strong>and those that are not. Home suppliers are the <strong>former incumbent </strong>suppliers &ndash; for <strong>electricity</strong> it is <strong>Scottish Power </strong>for <strong>South Scotland </strong>and <strong>SSE </strong>for <strong>North Scotland</strong>. When the gas sector was privatised in the 1980s there was only one <strong>gas</strong> supplier across the whole of Britain - <strong>British Gas</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <strong>electricity </strong>there is a divide between North and South Scotland &ndash; more than half (<strong>55%</strong>) of people in <strong>North Scotland </strong>are not with their <strong>home </strong>supplier, compared to almost seven in ten <strong>70%</strong> in <strong>South Scotland</strong>. Both regions are lower than <strong>Britain </strong>as a whole; <strong>77%</strong> of electricity customers in GB are not with their home supplier. There has been a steady <strong>movement away </strong>from <strong>home suppliers </strong>over time in both North and South Scotland, suggesting that over time customers may have been more engaged to proactively move away from their home supplier.&nbsp; <strong>Direct debit </strong>electricity customers in Scotland are most likely to choose a <strong>different supplier </strong>than their home supplier, whereas <strong>standard credit</strong> customers are more likely than average to <strong>stick </strong>with their <strong>home supplier</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>gas</strong>, there is even more movement away from the home supplier than electricity - more than seven in ten customers in both <strong>North</strong> (<strong>71%</strong>) and <strong>South </strong>(<strong>73%</strong>) Scotland are <strong>not with </strong>British Gas, similar to <strong>GB</strong> as a whole (<strong>72%</strong>). This has remained fairly stable for the last few years for North Scotland customers, whereas the proportion of <strong>South</strong> <strong>Scotland</strong> customers not with British Gas has steadily risen from <strong>57%</strong> in <strong>March 2013</strong>. &nbsp;Again, like electricity, <strong>credit customers </strong>in Scotland are most likely to be with their <strong>home</strong> suppliers.</p>
