<p><strong>Gas</strong> is the <strong>main heating fuel</strong> for <strong>domestic</strong> properties in Scotland, with eight in ten (<strong>81%</strong>) using it. Just over one in ten dwellings (<strong>11%</strong>) use <strong>electricity </strong>as the main method to heat their home and <strong>5%</strong> use <strong>oil</strong>. A greater proportion of <strong>newer properties</strong> (built after 1982) use <strong>electrical heating</strong> (<strong>13%</strong>) compared to the overall domestic stock. Sustainable heating methods such as communal heating and biomass are not widespread in Scotland, heating 1% of dwellings for each.</p>
<p>As approximately 15% of Scottish households are not connected to the gas grid, there are significant variations in main heating fuel by local authority. In 2018, <strong>Shetland and Orkney Islands</strong> have the biggest proportion of dwellings using <strong>electricity</strong> for <strong>heating</strong> (<strong>58%</strong> and <strong>57%</strong> respectively). About half (<strong>46%</strong>) of homes in the <strong>Western Isles</strong> are heated by <strong>oil</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Non-domestic</strong> properties show a different picture &ndash; the primary fuel for about half (<strong>50%</strong>) of non-domestic properties in Scotland is <strong>electricity</strong>, followed by <strong>natural gas</strong> (<strong>42%</strong>).</p>
