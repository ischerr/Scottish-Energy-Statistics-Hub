<p>The UK Government required supply companies to offer <strong>smart meters </strong>to their customers to enable them to monitor their energy usage. Data from Electralink suggests that as of <strong>February 2020</strong>, more than <strong>1.08 million </strong>smart meters were installed in Scotland, representing <strong>38.7%</strong> of all meters in Scotland. This is up from <strong>9.7%</strong> in <strong>November 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>Greater progress has been made in the smart meter rollout in South Scotland compared to North Scotland &ndash; <strong>43.1%</strong> of all <strong>South Scotland</strong> meters have been installed compared to <strong>27.5%</strong> in <strong>North Scotland</strong>.&nbsp; This may be a consequence of the fact that North Scotland is more sparsely populated than South Scotland, meaning that installing a large number of meters in North Scotland is more challenging.</p>
