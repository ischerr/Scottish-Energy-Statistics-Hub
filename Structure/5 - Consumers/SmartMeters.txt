<p>Scottish consumers have been <strong>increasingly monitoring</strong> their <strong>energy usage</strong> in the last ten years.&nbsp; According to the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-house-condition-survey-2018-key-findings/">Scottish House Condition Survey</a>, the proportion that say they <strong>closely monitor</strong> their <strong>energy usage</strong> has <strong>increased</strong> from <strong>44%</strong> in <strong>2008</strong> to <strong>58%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
<p>The UK Government required supply companies to offer <strong>smart meters </strong>to their customers to enable them to monitor their energy usage. Data from Electralink suggests that as of <strong>August 2020</strong>, almost&nbsp;<strong>1.14 million </strong>smart meters were installed in Scotland, representing <strong>40.5%</strong> of all meters in Scotland. This is up from <strong>9.7%</strong> in <strong>November 2016</strong>.&nbsp; Smart meter installations slowed since March 2020 as a result of the covid-19 lockdown, but showed signs of picking up as a result of easing of lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Greater progress has been made in the smart meter rollout in South Scotland compared to North Scotland &ndash; <strong>44.8%</strong> of all <strong>South Scotland</strong> meters have been installed compared to <strong>29.1%</strong> in <strong>North Scotland</strong>.&nbsp; This may be a consequence of the fact that North Scotland is more sparsely populated than South Scotland, meaning that installing a large number of meters in North Scotland is more challenging.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest that having a smart meter can make consumers <strong>more aware</strong> of their <strong>energy use</strong> and make energy saving changes as a consequence.&nbsp; According to <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/consumer-survey-2019">Ofgem&rsquo;s Consumer Engagement Survey</a>, of Scottish consumers that have a smart meter, almost six in ten (<strong>58%</strong>) say they <strong>monitor their energy use more closely</strong> and they encourage others in the household to <strong>use less energy</strong>&nbsp;</p>
