<p>It is possible to break down the reduction of Scotland&rsquo;s total energy consumption by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sector</strong></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy consumption in <strong>industry </strong>makes up approximately a third of all Scottish consumption (<strong>41.5 TWh</strong>). This is a <strong>25.5% reduction</strong> from the 2005-07 baseline, and <strong>6.2%</strong>&nbsp;down on <strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Energy consumption in the <strong>domestic sector </strong>is <strong>44.2</strong><strong>&nbsp;TWh</strong>.&nbsp; This is a <strong>decrease</strong> of <strong>16.1%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong>, which may reflect improvements in energy efficiency in the domestic building stock in this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consumption in the <strong>commercial </strong>sector <strong>fell </strong>by <strong>4.0% </strong>from the baseline to <strong>21.8 TWh </strong>in <strong>2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes in consumption of different <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fuels</strong></span> in Scotland has also changed over time:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petroleum</strong> products continue to make up the biggest proportion of Scotland's energy fuel mix, <strong>63.6 TWh</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>, <strong>down</strong>&nbsp;<strong>14.9%</strong> from the <strong>2005-07</strong> baseline, and <strong>down 4.5%</strong> on <strong>2018</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gas</strong> comprises about a third of all consumption (<strong>47.6 TWh</strong>), down <strong>20.3%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong></li>
<li>Scotland consumes <strong>24.1 TWh</strong> of <strong>electricity</strong>, <strong>down 17.9%</strong> from the baseline</li>
<li>Consumption of <strong>coal</strong> decreased the most in comparison to <strong>2005/07</strong>, <strong>dropping 44.7% </strong>to <strong>1.3 TWh</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The only fuel type where consumption <strong>increased</strong> is <strong>bioenergy</strong> and <strong>energy from waste</strong>, which has more than tripled between 2005-07 and 2019 (<strong>7.9 TWh</strong>).&nbsp;</li>
