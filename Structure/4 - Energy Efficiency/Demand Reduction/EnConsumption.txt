<p>It is possible to break down the reduction of Scotland&rsquo;s total energy consumption by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sector</strong></span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy consumption in <strong>industry </strong>makes up approximately a third of all Scottish consumption (<strong>48.0 TWh</strong>). This is a <strong>24.1% reduction</strong> from the 2005-07 baseline, and <strong>3.5%</strong>&nbsp;down on <strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Energy consumption in the <strong>domestic sector </strong>is next largest at <strong>43.6 TWh</strong>.&nbsp; This is a <strong>decrease</strong> of <strong>17.2%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong>, which may reflect improvements in energy efficiency in the domestic building stock in this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consumption in the <strong>commercial </strong>sector <strong>rose </strong>by <strong>11.9% </strong>from the baseline to <strong>17.1 TWh </strong>in <strong>2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes in consumption of different <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fuels</strong></span> in Scotland has also changed over time:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petroleum</strong> products continue to make up the biggest proportion of Scotland's energy fuel mix, <strong>68.0 TWh</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>down</strong>&nbsp;<strong>9.6%</strong> from the <strong>2005-07</strong> baseline, and <strong>down 2.8%</strong> on <strong>2017</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gas</strong> comprises about a third of all consumption (<strong>47.7 TWh</strong>), down <strong>20.4%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong></li>
<li>Scotland consumes <strong>24.2 TWh</strong> of <strong>electricity</strong>, <strong>down 17.6%</strong> from the baseline</li>
<li>Consumption of <strong>coal</strong> decreased the most in comparison to <strong>2005/07</strong>, <strong>dropping 39.8% </strong>to <strong>1.4 TWh</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The only fuel type where consumption <strong>increased</strong> is <strong>bioenergy</strong> and <strong>energy from waste</strong>, which has more than tripled between 2005-07 and 2017 (<strong>5.1 TWh</strong>).&nbsp;</li>
