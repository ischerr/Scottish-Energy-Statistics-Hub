<p>The previous <strong>energy consumption target </strong>published in the <a href="https://www2.gov.scot/Publications/2010/10/07142301/0">Conserve and Save: Energy Efficiency Action Plan</a> in October 2010 was to reduce Scottish final energy consumption by <strong>12%</strong> by <strong>2020 </strong>from a 2005 to 2007 baseline (169,597 GWh). Scotland met the target in <strong>2013</strong>, seven years early, and reached a record low of energy consumption in <strong>2015</strong>, <strong>14.0%</strong> below the 2005-07 baseline. Energy efficiency, the impact of the economic cycles, prevalent energy price rises and weather patterns have all played a role in reducing overall energy consumption by almost <strong>24,000 GWh</strong> from <strong>2005</strong> to <strong>2015</strong>.</p>
<p>Scotland's energy consumption increased since 2015, and is now <strong>13.8%</strong> below the 2005-07 baseline, still below the 12% target.&nbsp; This represents a <strong>0.9% decrease</strong> in total energy consumption between <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>2019</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
