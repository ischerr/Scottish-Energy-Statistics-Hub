<p>Energy efficiency levels in the Scottish housing stock are monitored using the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) and expressed as an Energy Efficiency Rating (EER). These ratings are banded from A to G, where A is a very efficient dwelling and G denotes a low energy efficiency dwelling.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland: Routemap</a> sets an ambition for 'every Scottish home to achieve <strong>at least a band C </strong>in its Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) by <strong>2040</strong> (where technically feasible and cost effective).</p>
<p>The<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> methodology to assess of the energy performance of a dwelling changed</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>SAP 2012 based on RdSAP (v9.93):</u> This is based on the latest methodology introduced in November 2017 and only data for <strong>2018 and 2019</strong> is available. Under this measure, more than four in ten (<strong>45%</strong>) Scottish homes were rated at least <strong>EPC band C.</strong></li>
<li><u>SAP 2012 based on RdSAP (v9.92):</u> This allows for comparisons over a longer period. </span>Under this measure <strong>47%</strong> of Scottish homes were rated as <strong>EPC band C</strong> or better in <strong>2019</strong>, up from 44% in 2018. However, it is up from <strong>35%</strong> in <strong>2014</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By way of comparison, <strong>34%</strong> of dwellings in <strong>England</strong> have an <strong>EPC</strong> rating of <strong>C</strong> or better according to the <strong>2018</strong> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey#2018-to-2019">English Housing Survey&nbsp;</a>(RdSAP changed to version 9.93 halfway through data collection).</p>
<p>The Energy Efficient Scotland Routemap sets further aims for energy efficiency of properties based on <strong>tenure</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><u>Maximise </u></strong><u>the number of <strong>social rented </strong>homes achieving <strong>EPC B </strong>by <strong>2032</strong></u></p>
<p>Social rented dwellings are among the most energy efficient in the Scottish stock, likely to be a result of improvements mandated under the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS).</p>
<p>In <strong>2019</strong>, just <strong>3% </strong>of social rented homes are at <strong>EPC band B</strong>, however <strong>37% </strong>are at least <strong>band C</strong>.</p>
<p><u>All <strong>owner occupied </strong>homes to reach <strong>EPC C </strong>by <strong>2040</strong> (where technically feasible and cost effective)</u></p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>37%</strong> of owner occupied homes were at least <strong>EPC band C</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>All private rented </u></strong><u>homes to <strong>EPC E </strong>by <strong>2022</strong>, to <strong>EPC D </strong>by <strong>2025</strong>, and to <strong>EPC C </strong>by <strong>2030 </strong>(where technically feasible and cost effective)</u></p>
<p>Regulation will be implemented in private rented homes in April 2020. More than nine in ten (<strong>91%</strong>) private rented dwellings are at least <strong>EPC band E</strong>, <strong>75%</strong> are at least <strong>band D </strong>and <strong>44% </strong>at least <strong>band C </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
<p>However, according to BEIS analysis using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-energy-efficiency-data-framework-need-report-summary-of-analysis-2018">National Energy Efficiency Data Framework</a>, private renters in Scotland have had the greatest <strong>decrease </strong>in median <strong>gas consumption </strong>from <strong>2011 </strong>to <strong>2017</strong>, dropping by <strong>11.5% </strong>compared to 7.1% for socially rented homes and 5.8% for owner occupied homes.</p>
