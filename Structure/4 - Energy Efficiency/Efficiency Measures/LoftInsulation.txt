<p>Loft insulation has improved&nbsp;over the last few years. In&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>93%&nbsp;</strong>of Scottish homes were&nbsp;<strong>insulated</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>100mm or more,&nbsp;</strong>similar to 2018 (94%),&nbsp;but an increase of&nbsp;<strong>12 percentage points</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>2010.</strong> This&nbsp;may&nbsp;be attributed to the installation of top-up insulation in the early 2010s.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>More than three-fifths (<strong>65</strong><strong>%</strong>) of dwellings have loft&nbsp;<strong>insulation</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>200mm or more&nbsp;</strong>in<strong>&nbsp;2019</strong>, a substantial rise from&nbsp;<strong>27%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2009.&nbsp;</strong>Much of this increase occurred between 2009 and 2013, when the percentage increased from 27% to 62%.&nbsp;This is still short of the aim in Scottish Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607679364405000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmrHhsm3ppV9X552Y4rtJH3qbBtA">Climate Change Plan</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>70%&nbsp;</strong>of lofts in the residential sector will have at least&nbsp;<strong>200 mm&nbsp;</strong>of insulation by&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><strong>In 2019,&nbsp;</strong><strong>30%</strong>&nbsp;of lofts were insulated to a high standard of insulation (<strong>300 mm</strong>&nbsp;or more), outlining scope for improvement to the highest level. This proportion has remained about this level since 2015, following year on year increases from&nbsp;<strong>5%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By <strong>2019</strong>, <strong>government schemes </strong>(CERT and ECO) delivered around <strong>485,000 </strong>loft insulation measures in Scotland.</p>
<p>The <strong>impact </strong>of loft insulation in terms of energy saving is not as great as wall insulation; the average <strong>saving </strong>in 2018 for Scottish homes was <strong>200 kWh</strong>, or <strong>1.6% </strong>of energy consumption.</p>
