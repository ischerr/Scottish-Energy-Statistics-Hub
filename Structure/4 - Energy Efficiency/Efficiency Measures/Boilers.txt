<p>Boilers in Scottish homes have been improving&nbsp;as well. In&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, more than seven in ten (<strong>76%</strong>) dwellings had a&nbsp;<strong>condensing</strong>&nbsp;<strong>boiler</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>this represents an <strong>increase</strong> of <strong>4 percentage points</strong> since <strong>2018</strong> and <strong>54 percentage points</strong> since <strong>2010. </strong>More than six in ten (<strong>64%</strong>) had a boiler that met the minimum efficiencies specified by the current&nbsp;<strong>Building Standards&nbsp;</strong><strong>which is similar to 2018 but a substantial increase from 30% in 2012</strong>.</p>
<p>Average <strong>savings </strong>for installation of condensing boilers in Scottish homes are <strong>1,000 kWh </strong>or <strong>7.4% </strong>of energy consumption.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that all of these energy efficiency savings do not take into consideration the &ldquo;<strong>rebound effect</strong>&rdquo;. This is where savings achieved through energy efficiency may be minimised by resulting changes in behaviour. For example, as a consequence of getting a new boiler, people may use it more often, and may increase their heat demand.</p>
