<p>The chart shows the <strong>gross value added </strong>(GVA) associated with the offshore <strong>oil and gas production </strong>which is estimated to occur in the Scottish portion of the UKCS. In <strong>2018</strong>, the extraction of oil and gas is worth an estimated <strong>&pound;11.6 billion </strong>in <strong>GVA </strong>to the <strong>Scottish economy</strong>. The contribution of oil and gas to the Scottish economy has increased for the second consecutive year, <strong>up </strong>by <strong>&pound;4.6 billion </strong>on <strong>2017</strong> to its highest level since 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is likely a consequence of <strong>increased prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Oil and gas production is equivalent to <strong>6.6% </strong>of total <strong>Scottish GDP </strong>(including a geographical share of UK Extra Regio activity) in 2018.</p>
