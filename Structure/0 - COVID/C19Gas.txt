<p><strong>Gas demand has also reduced</strong></p>
<p>Average daily demand analysis for gas before and after lockdown is in the chart above.&nbsp; This is trickier to interpret as gas demand depends largely on climatic conditions, hence variations in previous years.&nbsp; The data available has not been weather corrected.&nbsp; However, average weekday daily gas demand dropped by <strong>47%</strong> since lockdown compared to <strong>43%</strong> for the equivalent period in 2019. It is likely that at least some of this reduction is because of reduced activity since lockdown. Indeed, National Grid expects that any growth in domestic demand due to people being housebound during lockdown will be far outweighed by the expected reduction in demand from businesses and industry.</p>
