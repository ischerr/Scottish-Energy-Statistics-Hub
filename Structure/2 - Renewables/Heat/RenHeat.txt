<p>Scotland generated <strong>5,205 GWh&nbsp;</strong>of renewable heat in 2019, a record year for renewable heat.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the equivalent of supplying almost&nbsp;<strong>380,000 Scottish homes&nbsp;</strong>with gas for the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2009 Renewable Heat Action Plan set a target of delivering&nbsp;<strong>11%&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s non-electrical heat demand from renewable sources by <strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, useful renewable heat generated in Scotland was equivalent to&nbsp;<strong>6.6% </strong>of fuels (besides electricity) consumed for heat, up from <strong>6.2%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the rise in renewable heat output in 2019 is due to a 26% increase in biomethane output.</p>
