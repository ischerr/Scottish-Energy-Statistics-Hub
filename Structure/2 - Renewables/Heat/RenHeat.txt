<p>Scotland generated <strong>5,205 GWh&nbsp;</strong>of renewable heat in 2019, a record year for renewable heat.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the equivalent of supplying almost&nbsp;<strong>387,000 Scottish homes&nbsp;</strong>with gas for the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2009 Renewable Heat Action Plan set a target of delivering&nbsp;<strong>11%&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s non-electrical heat demand from renewable sources by <strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>, useful renewable heat generated in Scotland was equivalent to&nbsp;<strong>6.5%&nbsp;</strong>of fuels (besides electricity) consumed for heat, up from <strong>6.2%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the rise this year is due to newly operational biomass and energy from waste sites as well as an increased heat output from over half of the existing biomass sites.</p>
