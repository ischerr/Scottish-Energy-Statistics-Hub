<p>The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a UK Government scheme set up to encourage uptake of renewable heat technologies amongst householders, communities and businesses through financial incentives. The domestic scheme launched in April 2014.</p>
<p>By <strong>November 2020</strong>, there were <strong>16,278</strong>&nbsp;accredited domestic RHI applications in Scotland, <strong>up 11.6%</strong> on <strong>November 2019</strong>. This is <strong>19.4%</strong> of all accredited domestic applications in GB. More than half (<strong>60.0%</strong>) of accredited applications are for <strong>air source heat pumps</strong>, and of all technologies, this has had the biggest increase in applications in the last twelve months. <strong>Biomass</strong> makes up just a quarter (<strong>23.0%</strong>) of all accredited applications.</p>
<p>The majority of full accreditations are for buildings <strong>off the gas grid</strong> - <strong>87.2%</strong> by December 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scotland has <strong>1.1 TWh</strong> of heat paid for under the domestic scheme as of <strong>May 2020</strong>.</p>
