<p>The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) is a UK Government scheme set up to encourage uptake of renewable heat technologies amongst householders, communities and businesses through financial incentives. The domestic scheme launched in April 2014.</p>
<p>By <strong>December 2019</strong>, there were <strong>14,735</strong> accredited domestic RHI applications in Scotland, <strong>up 12.0%</strong> on <strong>December 2018</strong>. While the number of applications had been tailing off in 2017 and 2018, 2019 had the highest number of applications in a single year since 2016, with 1,759 applications.</p>
<p>More than half (<strong>56.3%</strong>) of accredited applications are for <strong>air source heat pumps</strong>, and of all technologies, this has had the biggest increase in applications in the last twelve months. <strong>Biomass</strong> makes up just over a quarter (<strong>26.0%</strong>) of all accredited applications.</p>
<p>Scotland has more than <strong>870 GWh</strong> of heat paid for under the domestic scheme as of <strong>June 2019</strong>.</p>
