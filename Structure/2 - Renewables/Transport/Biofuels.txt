<p>The main mechanism for the promotion of biofuel use, the <strong>Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) </strong>legislation places a requirement on transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a percentage of all road vehicle fuel is supplied from sustainable renewable sources.</p>
<p>Data for <strong>biofuels </strong>in petrol and diesel consumption is <strong>not available </strong>separately for <strong>Scotland</strong>. For the purposes of calculating the transport part of the renewable energy target for Scotland we take the <strong>UK proportion </strong>of biofuels against transport energy use as a proxy for Scottish biofuels.</p>
<p>In <strong>2020</strong>, biofuels had a <strong>5.8% </strong>share of road fuels in the <strong>UK</strong>. This has risen to its <strong>highest level</strong>, up from <strong>5.1% </strong>in <strong>2019</strong>.</p>
<p>This is below the <strong>9.75% </strong>share of renewable fuels by <strong>2020 </strong>which was an ambition under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-regulations-to-double-the-use-of-sustainable-renewable-fuels-by-2020">UK RTFO.</a></p>
