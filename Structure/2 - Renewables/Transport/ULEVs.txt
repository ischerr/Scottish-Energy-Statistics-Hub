<p>The Scottish Government has announced <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">its intention</a> to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032, and has supported adoption of <strong>ultra-low emission vehicles</strong> (ULEVs). This term refers to electric, plug-in hybrid, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles and all vehicles with tail-pipe emissions below 75 g/km of CO2.</p>
<p>As of <strong>September 2019</strong>, there were <strong>14,785 </strong>ULEVs licenced in Scotland, more than half of which are plug-in hybrid vehicles. Even though ULEVs only make up <strong>0.5% </strong>of all vehicles licenced in Scotland, <strong>growth </strong>has been <strong>rapid</strong>; compared to twelve months prior, ULEVs licenced <strong>rose</strong> by <strong>42.7%</strong>.</p>
<p>The growth of ULEVs can be further illustrated by looking at the proportion of ULEVs <strong>registered for the first time</strong>. This increased from <strong>0.2% </strong>of all newly registered vehicles in the <strong>first quarter</strong> of <strong>2014 </strong>to <strong>2.6%</strong> in <strong>Q3 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>Recorded consumption across the ChargePlace Scotland, Scotland&rsquo;s publicly funded EV charging network, was <strong>7,683 MWh&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2019</strong>.</p>
