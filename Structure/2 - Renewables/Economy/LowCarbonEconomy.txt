Most of this is made up of staff employed in <strong>energy efficiency </strong>(<strong>12,100 </strong>full-time equivalent staff) and <strong>low carbon electricity </strong>(<strong>7,800</strong>)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In 2018, the Scottish low carbon and renewable energy economy directly generated <strong>&pound;6.4 billion</strong>. The <strong>renewable energy </strong>part of the LCRE sector is particularly important in Scotland where it accounts for more than half of <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s low-carbon turnover</strong>. In contrast, renewable energy accounts for around <strong>35% </strong>of LCRE turnover in the <strong>UK </strong>as a whole.</p>
