<p><strong>As of March 2020, 289&nbsp;</strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>13.5 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. <strong>1.3 GW</strong> of these are <strong>under construction</strong>, most of which are <strong>offshore wind</strong> farms off the Moray Firth.&nbsp; <strong>7.7 GW </strong>are awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>4.5 GW in planning</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were all capacity in the pipeline to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed, and could generate an estimated <strong>31.9 TWh </strong>of renewable electricity. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors that mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
