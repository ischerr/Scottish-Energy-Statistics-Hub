<p>Scotland had <strong>11.9 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in June 2020</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, however, has levelled off since June 2019 as fewer projects have been able to access subsidies.&nbsp; This may slow Scotland's progress in renewable electricity generation.&nbsp; Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>8.4 GW</strong>), with <strong>offshore wind</strong> (<strong>1.0 GW</strong>) capacity increasing in the last few years.</p>
<p>Half of the renewable capacity in Scotland comes from <strong>large installations</strong> of over 50 MW (<strong>6.2 GW</strong> in total).&nbsp; However, a total of <strong>1.2&nbsp;GW</strong> comes from <strong>small-scale installations</strong> of less than 5 MW.&nbsp; These projects are important as they are likely to contribute to the development of smart, decentralised and local energy markets in Scotland.&nbsp; This is made up of <strong>442 MW&nbsp;</strong>of <strong>onshore wind</strong>, <strong>338 MW&nbsp;</strong>of <strong>solar PV</strong>, <strong>314 MW</strong> of <strong>hydro</strong> and <strong>133 MW</strong> of <strong>bioenergy and waste</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
